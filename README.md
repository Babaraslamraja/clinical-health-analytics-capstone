This project is a Clinical Health Analytics capstone aligned with the Google Advanced Data Analytics program, focused on analyzing synthetic clinical events data to build analytical foundations and decision-ready insights. The work follows the PACE framework (Plan → Analyze → Execute) to ensure structured, auditable analysis suitable for a professional portfolio. The dataset contains non-sensitive, synthetic patient-level clinical events used for exploratory analysis and readiness assessment. The current stage is Data Foundations, where dataset structure, quality, and key patterns have been analyzed and documented to support subsequent stages such as data cleaning and advanced analysis.
